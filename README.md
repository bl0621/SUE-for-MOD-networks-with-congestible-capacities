## üìñ Overview

Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) services (e.g., ride-hailing, bikeshare, carshare) present challenges for equilibrium modeling because operators‚Äô internal policies are often proprietary.  
This project introduces an **operation-agnostic stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model** that:

- Models **congestible capacities** via a **Flow-Capacity Interaction (FC) matrix**, capturing how flows influence available capacities without explicit operator policy assumptions.  
- Provides both a **forward model** (SUE with congestible capacities) and an **inverse model** (calibrating the FC matrix from observed data).  
- Proposes a **solution algorithm** based on a Frank‚ÄìWolfe method with a œÅ-bounded k-shortest-path generation.  
- Demonstrates applications with numerical examples and a real-world case study using NYC yellow taxi data.

## üß™ N-D Network Example (Notebook)

The `N-D_network_example.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the **toy numerical experiment** from Section 3 of the paper.  
It walks through the following steps:

1. **Imports and setup**  
   - Load Python packages for optimization, plotting, and data handling.  

2. **Read in the network**  
   - Load `Link_list.csv` containing link IDs, start/end nodes, capacities, and costs.  

3. **Build link‚Äìnode matrix**  
   - Construct `[Link, From, To, Capacity]` representation.  
   - Replace `999999` capacity entries with ‚àû to indicate uncapacitated links.  

4. **Build adjacency dictionary**  
   - Create mapping `N[i]` ‚Üí successor nodes, used later for path generation.  

5. **Define OD pairs and travel demand**  
   - Four OD pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (4,2), (4,3).  
   - Demand vector `r = [400, 800, 600, 200]`.  

6. **Generate cost adjacency matrix**  
   - Initialize `c_int` with uncongested link costs.  
   - Used for initial shortest path calculations.  

7. **Define Flow‚ÄìCapacity Interaction (FC) matrix**  
   - Construct `F` to capture how flows on one link affect capacities of others (Eq. (1)‚Äì(3)).  
   - Includes both negative (capacity consumption) and positive (capacity contribution) effects.  

8. **Run algorithms**  
   - Import `k_path_finding` (Algorithm 1) to generate candidate paths.  
   - Import `FW_SUECC` (Algorithm 2) to solve the forward SUE model via Frank‚ÄìWolfe.
