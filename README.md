# SUE-for-MOD-networks-with-congestible-capacities
We model multimodal equilibrium with MoD systems in an operation-agnostic manner based on empirical observations of flow and capacity. This is done with a Flow-Capacity Interaction (FC) matrix that captures systematic effect of congestible capacities, a phenomenon in MoD systems where capacities are affected by flows.
