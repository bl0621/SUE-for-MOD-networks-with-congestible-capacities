We model multimodal equilibrium with MoD systems in an operation-agnostic manner based on empirical observations of flow and capacity. This is done with a Flow-Capacity Interaction (FC) matrix that captures systematic effect of congestible capacities, a phenomenon in MoD systems where capacities are affected by flows. 

## üìñ Overview

Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) services (e.g., ride-hailing, bikeshare, carshare) present challenges for equilibrium modeling because operators‚Äô internal policies are often proprietary.  
This project introduces an **operation-agnostic stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model** that:

- Models **congestible capacities** via a **Flow-Capacity Interaction (FC) matrix**, capturing how flows influence available capacities without explicit operator policy assumptions.  
- Provides both a **forward model** (SUE with congestible capacities) and an **inverse model** (calibrating the FC matrix from observed data).  
- Proposes a **solution algorithm** based on a Frank‚ÄìWolfe method with a œÅ-bounded k-shortest-path generation.  
- Demonstrates applications with numerical examples and a real-world case study using NYC yellow taxi data.
